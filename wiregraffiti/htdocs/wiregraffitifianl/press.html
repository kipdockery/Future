		  <p> Local Spotlight<br>
		  May 2007 Issue</p>
		  <p>With a big ten year CD release anniversary just around the corner, this crowd-rousing four piece straight out of Oakland is driving 
		  full speed towards success. Since first emerging onto the scene in the late nineties, Wire Graffiti have wasted no time in proving that 
		  they're here to stay with a sound that can only be described as 'eeeeelectric'. Powered by vocalist/guitarist Katherine Sawyer,
		   guitarist Stev Ohanis, drummer Rob Tucker and bassist Rafa Corral, the band will soon celebrate their tenth year of battering sound
		    systems with their fourth full length which will feature original bass player Tim Sanchez. According to a June 2003 issue of 
		    Performer magazine, their songs take gothic rock sounds and put them in jazz and prog-rock structures full of dynamic changes, 
		    baroque embellishments and endless moody grooves, and thanks to a wide variety of collective influences, Wire Graffiti 
		    have reintroduced the Bay Area to rock n roll. Their talent demands attention and their melodies will cast a spell on you as
		     you slowly become addicted to their Come and celebrate Wire Graffiti's 10 year CD release anniversary on May 19 at San Francisco's
		      Bottom of the Hill.<br></p>

		  <p>After watching this band all I could say, wow! Such a mixture of sound....funk, punk, indie and rock! Wah now! The music blends No Means No, PJ Harvey, and Texas Terri &amp; The Stiff Ones. There are a few more I could mention, but you've got the idea. Katherine's exquisite vocals seize you with their sound, then sends ya into a trance of curiosity! Each song is completely different from the last. If you're lookin' for a new diverse sound, you must check Wire Graffiti out.</p>

		  <p>Katherine Sawyer, saxophone player turned singer/songwriter, is the fire in this band's barn. The quirky punk rocker sports what might be confused as spoken word and rock in a tug of war to be the prolific melange that makes this band rock. Sensational sounds and exceptional craftsmanship make this band a must listen.</p>

          <p>Bay area rockers unfold their gothic side without losing their ability to rock. With musical influences as diverse as PJ Harvey, Primus, and The Pixies, Wire Graffiti manages to dive deep into sound experimentation and eliminate the expected reservations one might have regarding any local band. Strong and well versed in their musical craft Wire Graffiti leaves you reeling in a world of bombastic guitars, vocals and rhythm. Katherine Sawyer's ethereal and hexed vocals remind me of Peter Murphy's during his Bauhaus days, especially during the opening track El Politico where the sparse instrumentation resembles Bauhaus' Bela Lugosi's Dead. Added to the mix as the song progresses are disjointed horns and keyboards giving the song a New Orleans kind of vibe. Roses to Snakes journeys from spoken word to anxious vocals, peppered with barely audible screams, and then back again. The lead guitar work by Stev Ohanis (guitar, percussion, synth,) is impressive here. Tim Sanchez (bass) and Rob Tucker (percussion) hold down the rhythm section with zeal and dedication. Mercury consists of eclectic and haunting melodies which transcend the common and boring song arrangement found in so many of today's top ten offerings. Katherine's sweet vocal ricochets hypnotically throughout its heavy melodic structure. Scavengers is furiously paced and a true to punk progressive song that has Katherine giving a sly laugh at the end of it. Peculiar Love has eleven original songs penned by various combinations of the members of Wire Graffiti. A superb mix of a variety of styles of music that never waivers from showcasing the stunning vocals of Sawyer and the expert musicianship of Ohanis, Sanchez and Tucker.</p>

            June 2003</p>
          <p>First and foremost, there's the voice. Wire Graffiti's Katherine Sawyer has a distinctive way of singing - her powerhouse voice is low-register, nasally, a little like a gothic cabaret artist. Think Siouxsie Sioux, Chrissie Hynde, Ani DiFranco, L7, Sleater Kinney. The music goes here, there, everywhere, but Sawyer's witchy voice dominates the proceedings. It demands, &quot;Pay attention. Listen to me.&quot; Which is irritating at first, but then grows on you. Second, there's the instrumentation. Tim Sanchez's bass and Sawyer's and Stev Ohanis' masterful guitars weave an intricate spell on Peculiar Love. The songs take gothic rock sounds and put them in jazz and prog-rock structures full of dynamic changes, baroque embellishments and endless moody grooves. The concept is to be admired, even if Peculiar Love sometimes veers into Halloween haunted house soundtrack territory. Third, there are the mood swings. Peculiar Love starts with a bit of vampire rock on &quot;El Politico,&quot; with dark, creeping keyboards, a racing drum machine and bleating jazz horns. The vampire stalking feel continues with dancing bass and plodding guitar of &quot;Liquid Sugar.&quot; The vampire becomes a circus freak as the music turns mathy and funky in the vein of Primus on &quot;Get Me Out&quot; and veers toward experimental beat poetry in &quot;Roses to Snakes.&quot; On &quot;Mercury,&quot; we return to the ghostly carnival cabaret, which is interrupted by a burst of bad-ass punk pop for &quot;Scavengers.&quot; The wicked beginning of &quot;Patent Pending&quot; (&quot;Oh you're mine mine to give and take from / now I want want more so you'll be less&quot; ) devolves into a sedate neurotic rock ballad, and &quot;Belle the Killer&quot; looms with big rock guitars and slow, echoing feedback. Add it all together, and Peculiar Love is quite a compelling bag of tricks.</p>

            Wire Graffiti/Bad Karma/Whore/Atomic Mint<br>
            March 8, 2003 - Stork Club, Oakland<br>
          </p>
          <p>Katherine Sawyer of Wire Graffiti says her [earliest] influences as a singer were Ann Wilson, Chrissy Hynde, The Go-Gos, and Rocky Horror Picture Show composer Richard O'Brien. Her band, however, isn't as easy to pinpoint. At times their complex arrangements sound avant-garde like Eno, Talking Heads or Public Image Limited. Other times they sound like a lush Zeppelin or Jane's Addiction. Occasionally they approach the musicianship of Joni Mitchell with her classic lineup (Metheny and Pastorius), guitarist Stev Ohanis suddenly shifting gears from quirky to lush to soulful. Why some more established indie label doesn't snatch these guys up is beyond me... (Ehem! Bella Union? Kitchen Whore? 4ad?). To be fair, Wire Graffiti can draw a crowd. Their Valentine's Day CD release party for Peculiar Love at San Francisco's The Pound was well attended.</p>

          <p>It's only fitting that leftfield rockers Wire Graffiti would celebrate the release of their new CD &quot;Peculiar Love&quot; (Hand Wash Music) with a Valentine's Day show. After all, irony is what they do best. Well, it's one of the things.</p>
          <p>Singer Katherine Sawyer's unsettling poetry is delivered as equal parts articulated slur, jaded whine and muted scream, layered ever-so-delicately over tunes that run the gamut from folk-rock to funk-rock to punk-rock. That should give you a basic idea of what to expect from this Oakland-based foursome. For a little more depth, check out the Web site www.wiregraffiti.com.</p>

          <p>I love compilation CDs. I really do. But this is the strangest one I've ever heard. It sounds like a collection of girl singers from over the last twenty years randomly put together. The thing is, I've never heard of any of these songs before.</p>
          <p>Spanning many musical styles from ska to rock and even some darker experimental stuff, every song feels like a different character fighting for control of the same body. A blend of piano, drums and a horn section grace &quot;El Politico&quot; while &quot;Messiah&quot; a very Ani DiFranco-like spoken word piece is backed by little more than electric guitars and drum. &quot;Belle The Killer&quot; sounds like a tribute to 80's heavy metal chick power. And yet, as much as each of the songs conflict, something undefinable ties them all together. Maybe it is the consistently surreal lyrics (&quot;Watch the cards/ Watch them fall/ In the center/ There'll be a star'). I suppose it could be the incredibly agile vocals applied to each song, complementing intricate layers of music.</p>
          <p>Wait, I just read the CD insert: Wire Graffiti, vocals by Katherine Sawyer. Who would have thought one group could be so schizophrenic?</p>

          <p>Picture this: A modern day Mae West with road rage at a busy intersection where PJ Harvey, Primus, Radiohead and the Pixies have just gotten into a pile-up.<br>
            Wire Graffiti started putting sounds to tape in 1995 when songwriters Katherine Sawyer and Stev Ohanis collided on the streets of Oakland. After recording their first CD Poetic Dictionary, a mostly folk-based album, they began fusing their styles after hitting the clubs in 1997. Inspired by a melange of punk, metal and techno along with Stev&sup1;s quirky rock style rubbing off on Katherine, they quickly developed a sound that drives easily from ethereal to hardcore, while still keeping one hand on their folk rock roots.<br>
          Wire Graffiti&sup1;s second recording, Hitting Traffic, established the band in the underground club scene with an ever-growing fan base, college radio exposure and television spots. Powered by bassist Tim Sanchez and drummer Rob Tucker the band has recently finished their third full length CD Peculiar Love set for release on Valentine's Day. Get wired Friday, Feb. 14th at the Pound SF with Venus Bleeding, Castles In Spain and the Angry Amputees, Feb. 21st at the Holiday Bowl in Hayward with Crackpot Theory, and on March 8th at the Stork Club in Oakland with Bad Karma, Whore and Atomic Mint.</p>

They're changing the way things are done. And they're changing them for the better.&quot;</p>

            Featuring Angelique X (Venus Bleeding), The Fire Ants, Lisa Hayle (Fiction), and Jayde</p>
          <p>&quot;Last to perform were Katherine Sawyer and Stev Ohanis. Their set opened with a compelling solo from Sawyer, whose versatile vocals range from lullaby sweet to rocking and raw. Ohanis is perfect, with tasty guitar parts. Sawyer's strumming is heavy handed and simple, but the strength of her songs shine through. &quot;I'm used to having a big ol' band behind me and stomping around ferociously,&quot; she tells the audience as if to explain her slight discomfort with performing acoustically. This made us love her even more!&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Taking a look at the politics of the band, the history of the members and the look of the front woman/songwriter Katherine Sawyer, you'll probably take a step back from your prior assumptions of just what Wire Graffiti sounds like. Katherine's voice is completely original, though it sometimes reminds me of Xtra Schneider (Clone) in a perverted way. Maybe she really is the alt-punk rock reincarnation of Mae West?</p>
          <p> Hitting Traffic blends many influences and styles, but determined to be original, Wire Graffiti chops them all up and serves the music as their ???own. The songs &quot;Nerve-Meter&quot;, &quot;Cupid's Crossbow&quot; and &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; can give you a red wine headache while &quot;Mean Old Man&quot; hints at a little shroom taking.&quot;<br>

          September 22nd, 2000</p>
          <p><br>
  &quot;It's easy to get absorbed in Wire Graffiti. It rises up and envelops you like a thick and choppy sea. Katherine Sawyer has one of those hypnotic and harrowing voices that draws you in but also makes you suspect she'll kick your ass if you're not careful. In one song it reminds me a little of Ani DiFranco, in another like Alanis, and once even a bit like Siouxsie. You know, that sort of voice. Yikes!&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;On slices of &quot;Cold Pizza&quot;, Stev Ohanis' guitar is dreamy and burbly one moment, buzzing and brutal the next, and Sawyer waxes and wanes to match. Jagged noodling and laconic, echoey semi-spoken vocals lend &quot;Mean Old Man&quot; a sinister feel, full of atmosphere and trajectory more then melody, like a chase scene through a thick fog. The fog thickens in &quot;The Storm&quot;, along with animalistic guitar squeaks and shimmers and sleepy synth. Infectious as it is-with clattering finger cymbals, trippy guitar kaleidoscopes, Sawyer's blase snarl, and a robotically funky rhythm-&quot;Magic Genie&quot; is definitely no &quot;Genie In A Bottle&quot;. It's a genie let loose from its bottle and taking you soaring (scarily) over blinding desert sands.&quot;</p>

            It's hard to say where exactly Wire Graffiti takes you with it's music-- somewhere exotic, hazy, dizzying, but still somehow exactly where you want to be. It's rock, certainly--driving, dissonant, and danceable--but it's laced with the best elements of folk, psychedelia, even a little trip hop (without the machines), without coming close to any easy classification. The interplay between Katherine Sawyer's haunting siren call and melismatic keening and Stev Ohanis' rambling eeeeelectric geetar is little short of mesmerizing.</p>
