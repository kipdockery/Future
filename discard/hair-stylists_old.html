		Owner Katherine Sawyer works with hair the way fashion designers work with textiles. With her many years of varied experience and undiminished ingenuity,
		she knows intuitively where to cut, what colors to apply, and how to create the most flattering look for any face shape and hair texture.
		At an early age Katherine's interest in the visual arts and portraiture led her to explore hair design as an outlet for her creativity.
		At 16 she attended cosmetology school and began her career assisting some of the best stylists and colorists in the Bay Area. Katherine went on
		to study at Jean Louis Deforge Academie in Paris and the Toni & Guy Hair Academy in London. In 1992, Katherine opened her own salon, dava dava,
		on Union St in San Francisco. The salon enjoyed 15 successful years, during which Katherine trained many assistants, stayed abreast of new techniques
		and trends and developed a loyal clientele that still see her today. In addition to salon work, she has also styled for runway, television and video,
		performed at hair shows, and taught cutting classes to other hairdressers. She is a certified Master Colorist with Framesi and continues to learn
		about new and exciting technology, recently adding NaYo, chemical-free color to her repertoire.<br />

		<img src="images/stylists/kaitrin.jpg" width="150" height="138" border="0" alt="Kaitrin_Sears" class="stylistPhoto" /><h2>Kaitrin Sears</h2>
		Kaitrin Sears' style journey began during her high school years when her mother got her a subscription to Sassy magazine. She remembers
		the inspiration she felt thumbing through the magazine's pages and the excitement of finding her natural affinity for fashion.
		Never afraid to try something new, Kaitrin enjoys pushing the boundaries of what's expected and accepted. She thinks personal expression should be
		limitless. When designing for clients, Kaitrin takes into account the natural growth of the hair and how that individual wants to identify with their
		style. Kaitrin believes there is fluidity to everything in life, and movement has a hand in how she adds her own personal touch to her designs. From
		the moment she began cosmetology school she was creating new and unexpected styles as well as learning to master the classics. Kaitrin joined FUTURE
		a month after it opened its door with over 15 years of experience that she gained while working at Alexander Pope. Recently, Kaitrin has become
		involved with hair, makeup and wardrobe for fashion shows and photo shoots and wishes to continue to pursue this outlet for her talents. An expert
		colorist, Kaitrin uses INOA, ammonia free hair color, and Wella and is a master at feather hair extensions. To see more of Kaitrin's work go to her

		<img src="images/stylists/rosa.jpg" width="150" height="138" border="0" alt="Rosa Jerez" class="stylistPhoto" /> <h2>Rosa Jerez</h2>
		Rosa is the newest addition to FUTURE's unstoppable group of stylists. Having graduated from San Francisco's Cinta Aveda Institute,
		she has been inspired by working with the team for over two years, and is quickly building a loyal following.
		Rosa earned her BA in English at Oberlin College but decided to follow her artistic inclinations to a career in hair.
		As seeing a client leave happy is her greatest delight, you can imagine her excitement in garnering more
		and more adorable fans upon whom to work her magic. Adding Balayage and Ombre to her repertoire, she revels in creative color placement and is an advanced Framesi colorist, as well as being proficient in
		ammonia and PPD free NaYo color. Rosa is also certified in keratin smoothing treatments, and amino acid smoothing treatments. Most recently, Rosa's talents are being put to use styling hair for a new web series called
		SanFranLand, created by a group from Pixar, that will be airing soon! <br />

		<img src="images/stylists/cari.jpg" width="150" height="138" border="0" alt="Cari Gelreich" class="stylistPhoto" /> <h2>Cari Gelreich</h2>
                Cari Geldreich, a stylist with over 20 years experience, has always loved doing hair. At age 11 she started cutting her own very straight hair and soon
		began working on her whole family, whose hair textures varied widely.  That early experience has contributed to her ability to work with all hair types,
		finding styles that don't fight the true nature of the hair. She believes a good haircut should continue to look great as it grows out and makes it her goal
		that the client be able to manage their hair long after they leave the salon. Her rapport with her clients is easy and fun and they appreciate her wry and witty sense of humor.
		Cari is always in pursuit of the most healthy and natural products available and is excited to be working with NaYo Color, an amazing chemical free color line. She has really enjoyed
		working at FUTURE because she feels inspired by the creative atmosphere, being involved with photo shoots for the salon, and the team's artistic vision.<br />
